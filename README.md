The code in this repository was written on purpose of a final exam where the task was to write a complete arcade game. 
The spaceship is controlled by mouse, the goal is to achieve the blue rectangle that randomly changes its location (corners) until 
the health bar is down. 

The code is not well structured, but Im very proud of that because lack of time and preasure were the harderst :)

The code is ready to use with Visual Studio 2022.
